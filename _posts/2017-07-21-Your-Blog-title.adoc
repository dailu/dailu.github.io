Two weeks is usually the amount of time people allow to see all of New Zealand. Not many have the luxury of two weeks just in the South Island, but for the sake of this post I’m going to assume you have time (or could come back), or that you’re not trying to see a country the size of Great Britain in five minutes! Mind you, while this post is geared to show you how to whip around the South Island in two weeks, it’s still fast with only a couple of days in most places.
